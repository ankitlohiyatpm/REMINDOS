/**
 * notifications/engine.ts — the ADHD-friendly notification engine.
 *
 * Philosophy: "fragrant garden, not iron cage." Every notification must read
 * like a supportive friend who gets it — never a manager watching you. ADHD
 * users live with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria; one guilt-tripping push can
 * cause an uninstall.
 *
 * This module is PURE and deterministic-where-it-matters (tier + selection are
 * fully deterministic; copy varies via a seedable picker). It has three jobs:
 *
 *   1. determineTier()        — how personal are we allowed to get? (cold-start safety)
 *   2. selectNotification()   — silence checks + which of the 6 types to fire
 *   3. generateNotification() — tier-scaled, anti-surveillance-safe copy
 *
 * The copy is gated through the validator backstop (./validate) so a forbidden
 * phrase can never reach a user even if a template regresses.
 *
 * Everything here is unit-testable without Convex, the network, or a clock —
 * callers pass in already-gathered signals. Wiring lives in the cron routes.
